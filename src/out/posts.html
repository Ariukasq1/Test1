<h3>What&#8217;s new?</h3>



<p><strong>New Segment Builder</strong></p>



<p>We&#8217;ve improved the Segments feature with a brand new design and capabilities.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cloud.headwayapp.co/changelogs_images/images/big/000/077/804-b14d1a46c0f8f80d17f6e6de031ac6052d7686ca.gif" alt="CleanShot 2021-11-03 at 23.00.45.gif"/></figure></div>



<p>With this improvement, you can:</p>



<ul><li>Use a combination of contact and its associated card properties (i.e., segment contacts with active deal/ticket/task cards)</li><li>Use the&nbsp;<code>and/or</code>&nbsp;logic to define the relationships between criteria</li><li>Group filter properties and assign&nbsp;<code>and/or</code>&nbsp;logic to a group of criteria or individual criteria</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cloud.headwayapp.co/changelogs_images/images/big/000/077/803-167cc7ca090f59749d351c3ea4bc2aa7dfa0d801.png" alt="CleanShot 2021-11-03 at 22.59.09@2x.png"/></figure></div>



<p><strong>Filter before exporting items</strong></p>



<p>You can use the Segment building to filter your items and export them now. For example, if you&#8217;d like to export Leads with the tag &#8220;Newsletter&#8221;:</p>



<ol><li>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Leads</strong>&nbsp;from the Import/Export menu</li><li>Select the properties to export</li><li>Choose the filter as Tag equals Newsletter and click&nbsp;<strong>Apply Filter</strong></li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Apply</strong>&nbsp;(required)</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Export</strong></li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cloud.headwayapp.co/changelogs_images/images/big/000/077/665-629d0b3e332d00746cd68e2c58ff6d0d3aeb459b.gif" alt="CleanShot 2021-11-02 at 15.38.30.gif"/></figure></div>



<p><strong>New Custom Property type: List</strong></p>



<p>Now you can create a new custom property where you type in any number of text inputs as a list. You can create this type of property for any of the erxes items in Settings/Properties.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cloud.headwayapp.co/changelogs_images/images/big/000/077/774-3958ed616c715f80641f10b308ce125ffcc63494.gif" alt="CleanShot 2021-11-03 at 17.00.40.gif"/></figure></div>



<p><strong>New Pipeline View: Activity</strong></p>



<p>As promised, we&#8217;ve added the Activity view for Pipelines. To see the activities of a single pipeline, please choose this view from the top right section and select the type of activity you&#8217;re looking for. We will be adding more activity types in future sprints.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cloud.headwayapp.co/changelogs_images/images/big/000/077/776-6ff18dd90120ac92e976deaf6edd37373c2af772.gif" alt="CleanShot 2021-11-03 at 17.07.13.gif"/></figure></div>



<h3>Bug Fixes and UX Improvements</h3>



<p><strong>General</strong></p>



<ul><li>Added a back button for Knowledgebase articles displayed in the Messenger (from the article list back to the subcategory.)</li><li>Any audio files sent through the Facebook integration can be listened to straight from the Team Inbox conversation now:</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cloud.headwayapp.co/changelogs_images/images/big/000/077/777-f3f6924a2e3aa569536fddf02295918659c79f67.png" alt="CleanShot 2021-11-03 at 17.33.31@2x.png"/></figure></div>



<ul><li>Fixed: issues with sending attachments, media files, and links through Facebook integration.</li><li>Fixed: couldn&#8217;t export tags, deal, board, pipeline, product, amount data.</li><li>Fixed: profile images of chat operators were stretched and did not auto-adjust.</li><li>Fixed: couldn&#8217;t move between slides of a Campaign creation.</li><li>Fixed: image sizes were not auto-adjusted when viewing Knowlegdebase articles in Messenger.</li><li>Resolved: due to the recent Chrome update, the file upload was not showing.

<p class="has-drop-cap">From the start of human civilization, we depended on completing various projects to advance our life. Our ancestors&#8217; first significant project was hunting and gathering. Next was agricultural, and the one after that was industrial. Even though modern project management has its roots back in the 1950s, we can all agree that it has its origins even from ancient times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we can see that most organizations prefer agile project management, which even influenced the well-known DevOps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first time I came into contact with this terminology was during my university years. I still remember that the number one key differentiator between standard project management and agile project management is that agile is iterative. Also, it is fast and produces deliverables that are more superior to the old ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every organization needs agile project management before they embark on a quest that affects a lot of stakeholders at once. They also should use technology to help them get through the project fast but effectively. With that in mind, erxes is the right solution for your future projects.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://erxes.io/signup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dpVW6RqaFjtzwhrkHsewvtfyIE5V6Y9FA1JXpc6n5ZYuHDQab37NDMHzHwiDTA2iasKVWcXj8MoIRFue5E-lsTUXboh7dybPjew6MTLzrF41v1XVi5cc7KUkqb7ZbdvAWLCVTFnfk_-XKeuXTA" alt="Project Management Software called erxes shown with its dashboard" /></a></figure>



<p>You can use erxes as an agile project management tool by:&nbsp;<br></p>



<ul><li>Dividing up the process by creating boards and pipelines</li><li>Assigning specific tasks for the team members</li><li>Putting deadlines for the various tasks</li><li>Iterate the process in seconds by dragging and dropping</li><li>Starting a timer for each job to monitor overall performance</li><li>Give and receive updates by notes and checklists</li><li>Control costs through custom created properties</li><li>Manage each process of the project by quickly accessing each pipeline</li><li>Workers update on the process even during physical work through a mobile app</li><li>Send automatic emails to the sponsor or internally when the project finishes or changes stages, and much more!</li></ul>

<h3>What&#8217;s new?</h3>



<p><strong>Print or save a Form submission as a pdf 🖨</strong></p>



<p>We added the ability to save or print any individual Form as a pdf file. One way to print a form is to click on the&nbsp;<code>print</code>&nbsp;icon at the bottom right of the Form conversation in the Team Inbox. Another way is to print a form displayed in the activity log of a Contact Profile:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cloud.headwayapp.co/changelogs_images/images/big/000/074/121-b4cf91f4711563e284ce590072065474d286cdaa.gif" alt="CleanShot 2021-08-31 at 16.03.50.gif"/></figure></div>



<ul><li>If you wish to save the form submission as a pdf file, make sure you click on the&nbsp;<code>Destination</code>&nbsp;field when the print window appears.</li><li>If no printer is connected to your computer, the default is to only save as a pdf.</li><li>If you wish to make edits to the file before printing, save it as a pdf first and edit the file with your preferred software, such as Adobe Acrobat.</li><li>At the moment, you can only print a single form submission.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Upgraded onboarding bot 🤖</strong></p>



<p>The newly revamped bot guides new users by the stages of the onboarding process, compared to the old guide when it onboarded users by features. The main onboarding stages are now:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Setup</strong>&nbsp;steps are the most important and should be set first,</li><li><strong>Operational</strong>&nbsp;steps should be completed after finishing the setup steps and include necessary actions to configure individual core features of erxes.</li><li><strong>Ongoing</strong>&nbsp;steps are actions you may need to complete and update multiple times depending on your use case.</li></ol>



<p>Even though the new guide is more thorough, it has been categorized into manageable steps.</p>

<ul><li>erxes is now available in 18 more languages: Arabic, Albanian, Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch, Javanese, Kazakh, Marathi, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Tamil, Telugu, Ukrainian, Urdu, and Yiddish. Previously existing languages are English, French, German, Mongolian, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Hindi, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Bengali, Serbian, Turkish.</li><li>The updated list of available languages is sorted alphabetically in the Settings/System Config/General section.</li><li>This improvement also includes the translations of the erxes widgets, such as Forms, Messenger, and Knowlegdebase.

Any missing translations for the Messenger widget have been added as well.</li></ul>

This will help translators and reviewers assign the most appropriate translation of the text. The tags are either by feature or page name.

<h3>What&#8217;s new?</h3>



<h4>Updated Navigation</h4>



<p>As part of our UX improvement project, we overhauled the sidebar menu and the Settings page navigation.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cloud.headwayapp.co/changelogs_images/images/big/000/072/558-6a9e6e7c1ecfc20458237c46c8fe6627f9817156.gif" alt="CleanShot 2021-08-05 at 18.21.49.gif"/></figure></div>



<p><strong>General</strong></p>



<ul><li>Updated the icons on the top right and resized buttons with different sizes to make them consistent.</li><li>Updated the user profile dropdown navigation.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Sidebar</strong></p>



<ul><li>Updated the sidebar menu to be expandable, where you can see the feature&#8217;s name without hovering over the icon.</li><li>Grouped core features into different categories depending on the use case: Team Inbox, Contacts, Marketing, Sales, Support, Management. This new design will also help keep things less cluttered when rolling out new features in each category.</li><li>Added the associated settings in each category. For example, if you click on Tags under Contacts, you will go directly to the Contact Tags settings page.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Settings Main Page</strong></p>



<ul><li>Added new icons.</li><li>Made the header description area expandable.</li><li>Classified settings types into different groups depending on the use case.<ul><li>General: the most basic and must-have settings</li><li>Team Members: all things related to Team Members.</li><li>Multipurpose: any settings that are used in two or more features</li><li>Feature: individual feature settings specific to that feature only</li><li>Monitoring: the lesser-used activity and status monitoring settings</li></ul></li><li>Made the left sidebar UI the same across all settings detail pages.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23444147/126100284-e196ee1f-9476-47d0-b237-4589d9737cb1.png" alt="erxes settings"/></figure>



<h3>Bug Fixes and UX Improvements</h3>



<p><strong>General</strong></p>



<ul><li>Added new words and phrases of recently developed features into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.transifex.com/erxes-inc/public/">Transifex</a>. Transifex is the publicly accessible platform for contributing translations and localizing erxes for your country or region.</li><li>Only Latin letters are allowed in the team member&#8217;s username field. With this change, team members will be able to have consistent usernames across different languages and quickly find each other when mentioning in notes.</li><li>Fixed: customers couldn&#8217;t add experiment cards in the Growth Hacking feature.</li><li>Fixed: date picker for filtering Cards was not working on Safari.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Campaign</strong></p>



<ul><li>You can see which contacts were skipped after sending a Campaign email from the Log section. These contacts are skipped and unsubscribed if they didn&#8217;t open a certain number of previously sent emails. This number can be set by going to Settings/System Config/Campaign Config/General Settings and changing the number under&nbsp;<code>ALLOWED EMAIL SKIP LIMIT.</code>&nbsp;If you accidentally set this number too low and your contact is not receiving emails, please change the&nbsp;<code>EMAIL SKIP LIMIT</code>&nbsp;in the Settings and&nbsp;<code>Subscribed</code>&nbsp;status in the individual Contact Profile. Unfortunately, bulk updating contacts&#8217; subscriptions is not possible because of compliance issues.</li><li>Fixed: Manual Campaign emails were not sending.</li><li>Fixed: Personalization attributes were not working in Campaign email contents.</li></ul>

<p>Digital consumer experience is shaping today&#8217;s competitive trends. Using technology to communicate with customers requires little effort but is significantly effective. This opens an opportunity to have a competitive advantage in the digital era.</p>



<p>In this article, we will look into the main channels used to interact with organizations:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Emails</strong> (for professional inquiries)</li><li><strong>Live Messenger Chat</strong> (for FAQs)</li><li><strong>SMS </strong>(for product/service offers)</li></ul>



<p>The era of digital customer experience has ushered in a litany of competing priorities: interactions that are omnichannel and ever-present, yet not intrusive, and low-effort experiences, but high impact. With so many competing priorities and channels, it can be easy for customer experience leaders to get overwhelmed by the waves of digital change.</p>



<p><strong>What are the obstacles?</strong></p>



<p>These issues can arise when essential channels of communication are not managed well:</p>



<ul><li>Loss of the opportunity to make loyal customers due to the lack of attention to new customers</li><li>Inefficient delivery of information</li><li>Loss of important information due to information not being sent to regular users</li><li>Numerous issues in the organization&#8217;s operation (e.g., time spent sending messages to customers)</li></ul>



<p><strong>So what are the options to address these issues?</strong></p>



<p>As &lt;60% of customers check emails from their phones, SMS and email marketing is quite effective. Erxes saves time and effort by sending regular emails to your customers (invoices, contracts, brochures, etc.). You can also adjust it so only certain emails are sent to certain customers.</p>



<p><strong>Why is this important now?</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.cxtoday.com/contact-centre/delivering-an-excellent-omni-channel-experience/">9 out of 10 users</a> want an omnichannel experience from the organization. When consumers connect with a brand, they do not see the difference between the channels. Thus, users want to be recognized regardless of the channels used. It is important to collect data from all channels and update the customer data to identify the user.</p>



<p>&#8211; Users who connect to three or more channels make <a href="https://blog.benemen.com/articles/improve-omnichannel-customer-experience">287% more</a> purchases than users who connect to a single channel.</p>



<p>&#8211; Email marketing has an ROI of 4,300% (Direct Marketing Association)</p>



<p>&#8211; SMS marketing has an almost perfect open rate of 98 percent (<a href="http://shift">Gartner</a>)</p>



<p><strong>What are the next steps?</strong></p>



<p>As all channels are unique, the easiest way to deliver information to target audiences is to use Campaigns on erxes.</p>



<ul><li>Determine the user&#8217;s journey in all channels</li><li>Identify and select the most effective one</li><li>Run the campaign on erxes</li></ul>



<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>



<p>Here are ways you can use Campaigns effectively:</p>



<ul><li>Automatic greeting messages on your website using the <strong>Visitor Auto Campaign</strong></li><li>When a user first visits your website, they need guidance to navigate. From creating an account to finding products &amp; services information, the customer may need guidance. You will need to research which parts are most important. Then you can deliver the information you want to your customers through Campaigns.&nbsp;</li><li>Follow these steps:</li><li>Campaign -&gt; New Campaign -&gt; Visitor auto campaign -&gt; Compose your campaign</li><li>Transactional Emails for Pipeline Stage Changes with <strong>Auto Email Campaigns</strong></li><li>If your organization needs to send emails at certain times (contract, invoice, etc.), you can set up automatic emails. When you drag the card to another stage, the email will automatically send. <a href="https://headwayapp.co/erxes-inc-updates/set-auto-campaigns-for-pipelines-193845">Read more</a></li><li>This helps manage your customers, create a flow of information, and operate without any time gaps.</li></ul>



<p>/You can set automatic emails to be sent when you drag a card to a different stage as they progress along your Deal/Task/Ticket pipelines: text/</p>



<ul><li><strong>Inbound Marketing Drips </strong>with Auto Email Campaigns</li><li>A drip email campaign is a pre-prepared email for specific times or based on user behaviors. These include:</li><li>Welcome: This establishes new relationships, creates a positive experience, and provides guidance.</li><li>Onboarding: This gives customers information on creating an account or using the platform.</li><li>Lead nurturing: This is an email designed to make free registered users to lead. It may provide useful information such as e-books and sample templates.</li></ul>



<p>You can also use erxes to deliver information through other channels such as mobile messaging and live chat. This also saves time, reduces costs, and creates a positive customer experience.</p>

<p>Omnichannel marketing can benefit your organization in numerous ways. For example, it increases your customer retention rate by 90% and customer engagement by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.clickz.com/onmichannel-marketing-automation-statistics-for-2019/231381-2/231381/" target="_blank">18.86%</a>.  </p>



<h4><strong>What is omnichannel marketing?</strong></h4>



<p>Customer-centric businesses use omnichannel marketing tools to encourage effective operations. We often confuse omnichannel marketing with multichannel marketing, but they are quite different. In multichannel marketing, you send a common message through individual channels to get a user from point A to point B. Omnichannel marketing concentrates on every step of the customer journey by providing different types of content through connected channels. It meets the needs of the customers through personalized and consistent services. Fulfilling your customer&#8217;s unique needs helps you gain loyal customers and increase satisfaction. All this not only will benefit your customers, but also your brand. When implementing and using omnichannel marketing, make sure to consider the following:</p>



<h4><strong>1. Meet your customers where they are</strong></h4>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cxtoday.com/contact-centre/delivering-an-excellent-omni-channel-experience/" target="_blank">9 out of 10</a> customers say they desire an omnichannel experience from organizations. Consumers usually do not recognize the difference between channels that organizations use. Thus, you should be able to connect with your customers regardless of the channel used. It&#8217;s important to have access to all your customer&#8217;s channels and keep your database up to date. Find and accommodate your customers to make their experience smoother. </p>



<h4><strong>2. Focus on customer experience</strong></h4>



<p>Understanding your customers is the first step to creating positive experiences. It&#8217;s crucial to take complaints and customer data information from all channels into account. Make sure to provide prompt and efficient solutions to create positive customer experiences. You can read more about how to create positive customer experiences <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://erxes.io/blog/posts/five-ways-to-create-a-positive-customer-experience" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>



<h4><strong>3. Connect conversations across all channels</strong></h4>



<p>The customer recognition process is the most important thing for an organization. You should collect customer data from all channels. This will help ensure a smooth experience if a customer changes communication channels. This will help you offer the right solutions at the right times based on the right information. With this positive customer experience, repeat purchases and positive publicity will increase. For example, customers who communicate through three or more channels make <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog.benemen.com/articles/improve-omnichannel-customer-experience" target="_blank">287%</a> more purchases than those who use one channel.  </p>



<h4><strong>4. Invest in CX technology</strong></h4>



<p>Investing in good automation or technology solutions can benefit you. It can improve customer service, reduce costs, and create a positive customer experience. This enables you to reach customers at a low cost and efficiently use your resources.</p>



<h4><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h4>



<p>As you can see, using omnichannel marketing can bring your organization to the next level. It will be a step forward to become a <strong>customer-centric organization</strong>. You can:</p>



<ul><li>Make the most optimal operational and marketing decisions</li><li>Create loyal customers</li><li>Reduce costs</li><li>Improve the quality of customer service</li><li>Develop and maintain your customer database</li><li>Become a customer-centric organization</li></ul>

<p>Although 80% of executives believe they fully meet their customer&#8217;s needs, only<a href="https://media.bain.com/bainweb/PDFs/cms/hotTopics/closingdeliverygap.pdf"> 8% </a>agree. As their expectations are not met, <a href="http://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-CNTNT-Report-DynService-2017-global-state-customer-service-en-au.pdf">56%</a> of customers choose to walk away from an organization. About 47% prefer to use another brand if they have negative experiences. There are many avoidable mistakes that organizations overlook. By familiarizing yourself with these, you can optimize your customers&#8217; experience. These mistakes include:</p>



<p style="font-size:30px" class="has-text-color has-secondary-color"><strong>1. Not prioritizing the customer&#8217;s journey</strong></p>



<p>Customers go through a unique journey from the moment they discover a brand to become loyal customers. They interact with all touchpoints in the customer journey. Wrong impressions during any of these points become a pain point for customers. A pain point is a problem that may bother customers when they are purchasing a good. For example, if an online store&#8217;s pay menu doesn&#8217;t work, the user may get frustrated. Thus, that step in the customer&#8217;s journey becomes a pain point. If an organization fails to work on these pain points, it will lose customers.</p>



<p style="font-size:30px" class="has-text-color has-secondary-color"><strong>2. Not having a clear call to action</strong></p>



<p>When marketing activities or messages are vague and unorganized, customers will become confused. Clear instructions in your marketing content are crucial to avoid negative experiences. Without clear calls of action, the rest of your marketing efforts may go to waste. So, it’s vital to guide your customers to avoid confusion efficiently.</p>



<p style="font-size:30px" class="has-text-color has-secondary-color"><strong>3. Not using the customer&#8217;s data</strong></p>



<p>Customers provide a lot of valuable data when using a company&#8217;s services or buying a product. So, while making marketing or operational decisions, use customer data properly. It helps avoid negative experiences and competitive disadvantages.</p>



<p style="font-size:30px" class="has-text-color has-secondary-color"><strong>4. Not connecting with customers on multiple channels</strong></p>



<p>Having many channels for customers to contact the organization is vital. Having many channels provides opportunities to communicate and buy products in apt ways.&nbsp; For example, it&#8217;s not suitable to send information via email to someone who often does not use their email. Connecting with customers through various channels helps keep everyone well informed and pleased.</p>



<p style="font-size:30px" class="has-text-color has-secondary-color"><strong>5. Not providing a personalized experience</strong></p>



<p>It&#8217;s vital to balance focus on getting new customers and maintaining current customers. You should always provide personalized help to new and old customers. Provide personalized customer experiences to reduce the risk of losing loyal customers.</p>



<p style="font-size:30px" class="has-text-color has-secondary-color"><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>



<p>Addressing these listed issues helps your organization become more <strong>customer-centric</strong>. By acknowledging and improving on these common customer experience mistakes, you can:</p>



<ul><li>Optimize operational and marketing decision</li><li>Improve the quality of customer service</li><li>Reduce inefficient costs</li><li>Create a customer database&nbsp;</li><li>Become a customer-centric organization</li></ul>



<p>These also enable you to increase your sales.

<p>We had the opportunity to interview one of our first angel investors &#8211; Otgonbat S., who is the director of Ottegen Holdings and one of the biggest angel investors in the Mongolian technology sector. Mr. Otgonbat has been successful in the business for a long time. He currently manages companies in Mongolia and the United States. </p>



<p><strong>Why did you start investing?</strong></p>



<p>I met with founders of 30 technology startups during an event. I chose to invest in two: Insur and erxes. As of now, I have invested in 5 startups in total. Of which, Insur was the first investment I made. I admired their goal of solving a significant problem in society, social insurance. I liked the courage and determination they had to tackle a problem that even large companies had not been able to solve.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you choose to invest in erxes?</strong></p>



<p>About a year beforehand, I met the CEO of erxes, Mend Orshikh. He knew exactly what his goal was, to go into Silicon Valley. They also had the advantage of having a team that had been working together for a long time. Their choice of a B2B model also seemed like an advanced decision. The fact that the platform already had regular users also piqued my interest. I even tried using the platform myself.<br>As of now, a total of 26 people have invested in erxes through their innovative investment method. Erxes uses Continuous Securities Offering (CSO) to allow more people to become investors. They launched this method for a legal and financial start to joining Silicon Valley. Thus, erxes is well prepared and most definitely on the right track.</p>



<p><strong>What do you think are the benefits or advantages of investing in a startup company over others?</strong></p>



<p>I enjoy the fact that you also have the opportunity to learn with the company. I find it interesting that it&#8217;s not all about the finances. You can mentor and help the company in other ways.</p>



<p><strong>How do you choose a company to invest in? What aspects do you value?</strong></p>



<p>I look at the people within the company. When investing, you are betting on a company and the person who started the company’s idea. Even if the present idea doesn&#8217;t go as planned, it&#8217;s still an investment into the next idea. I invest and put faith in the person&#8217;s motivation and ability to persevere. The confidence and diligence of the people in charge determine the success of a business. Aside from the people, I also take the company&#8217;s future vision and culture into account.</p>



<p><strong>What advice would you give to new investors?</strong></p>



<p>They should think about the reason for their investment other than financial gain. You should also consider the importance and impact of the investment. For example, I value tech companies because not only do they speed up ecosystem development, but they also help shape a sound infrastructure and legal environment.</p>



<p><strong>What are your future investment plans?</strong></p>



<p>I am currently looking into companies in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). They sell shares of more than 2,000 large companies around the world.<br>Similar to when a person decides to buy a car, one must research before investing. For example, they&#8217;ll study the model of the vehicle and all the alternatives. Likewise, it would be best if you researched before buying stocks. Before you invest, make sure to research the competitors within the industry.</p>



<p><strong>Extra question: Are there any life hacks you have for this quarantine?</strong></p>



<p>During this quarantine, you should take advantage of the extra time and learn new skills. Everyone from all over the world is spending most of their time at home during this difficult time. So, you should fill the extra time with a worthwhile activity to keep your mind active.</p>

I chose to invest in two: Insur and erxes. As of now, I have invested in 5 startups in total. Of which, Insur was the first investment I made. I admired their goal of solving a significant problem in society, social insurance. I liked the courage and determination they had to tackle a problem that even large companies had not been able to solve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did you choose to invest in erxes?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a year beforehand, I met the CEO of erxes, Mend Orshikh. He knew exactly what his goal was, to go into Silicon Valley. They also had the advantage of having a team that had been working together for a long time. Their choice of a B2B model also seemed like an advanced decision. The fact that the platform already had regular users also piqued my interest. I even tried using the platform myself.\u003cbr\u003eAs of now, a total of 26 people have invested in erxes through their innovative investment method. Erxes uses Continuous Securities Offering (CSO) to allow more people to become investors. They launched this method for a legal and financial start to joining Silicon Valley. Thus, erxes is well prepared and most definitely on the right track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you think are the benefits or advantages of investing in a startup company over others?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI enjoy the fact that you also have the opportunity to learn with the company. I find it interesting that it\u0026#8217;s not all about the finances. You can mentor and help the company in other ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you choose a company to invest in? What aspects do you value?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the people within the company. When investing, you are betting on a company and the person who started the company’s idea. Even if the present idea doesn\u0026#8217;t go as planned, it\u0026#8217;s still an investment into the next idea. I invest and put faith in the person\u0026#8217;s motivation and ability to persevere. The confidence and diligence of the people in charge determine the success of a business. Aside from the people, I also take the company\u0026#8217;s future vision and culture into account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat advice would you give to new investors?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey should think about the reason for their investment other than financial gain. You should also consider the importance and impact of the investment. For example, I value tech companies because not only do they speed up ecosystem development, but they also help shape a sound infrastructure and legal environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are your future investment plans?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI am currently looking into companies in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). They sell shares of more than 2,000 large companies around the world.\u003cbr\u003eSimilar to when a person decides to buy a car, one must research before investing. For example, they\u0026#8217;ll study the model of the vehicle and all the alternatives. Likewise, it would be best if you researched before buying stocks. Before you invest, make sure to research the competitors within the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExtra question: Are there any life hacks you have for this quarantine?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this quarantine, you should take advantage of the extra time and learn new skills. Everyone from all over the world is spending most of their time at home during this difficult time.
